        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>These chicken kabobs are marinated in a sweet and savory soy sauce and honey mixture that doubles as a basting sauce as the kabobs cook on the grill, adding delicious flavor to every bite of juicy chicken.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1/3 cup honey</li>
            <li>1/3 cup soy sauce</li>
            <li>1/4 cup vegetable optional</li>
            <li>1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
            <li>8 skinless, boneless chicken breast halves, cut into 1-inch cubes</li>
            <li>5 small onions, cut into 2-inch pieces</li>
            <li>2 medium red bell peppers, cut into 2-inch pieces</li>
            <li>2 cloves garlic</li>
            <li>12 bamboo skewers, or as needed, soaked in water for 30 minutes</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>To make the marinade: whisk honey, soy sauce, oil, and black pepper 
                together in a large glass bowl.
            </li>
            <li>Remove 1/4 cup of the marinade to a small jar; seal and set aside 
                to use while cooking.
            </li>
            <li>Add chicken, onions, bell peppers, and garlic to the marinade in 
                the large bowl. Cover and marinate in the refrigerator for 2 hours or
                overnight.
            </li>
            <li>When ready to cook, preheat an outdoor grill for high heat and lightly 
                oil the grate.
            </li>
            <li>Drain marinade from chicken and vegetables; discard marinade. Thread 
                chicken and vegetables alternately onto skewers.
            </li>
            <li>Place kabobs on the preheated grill. Cook, turning frequently and 
                brushing with reserved marinade, until nicely browned on all sides 
                and chicken is no longer pink in the center, about 12 to 15 minutes.
            </li>
            <li>Serve hot and enjoy!</li>
        </ol>
